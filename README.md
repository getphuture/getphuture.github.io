#Design

[Tom Watson](http://www.tmwtsn.com)'s personal page is my reference in layout.  
Perfectly straight to the point in both showing and writing.

Colors are borrowed from the excellent [Solarized Theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). 
Distributed for free by Ethan Schoonover under the MIT License. Formats available for lots of softwares.  
I love the light version. A dark version exists, some prefer the [Monokai variants](http://colorsublime.com/?q=monokai), also a must.

Typography is a custom webfont mashup from the following fonts:

* [Kalam](https://github.com/itfoundry/kalam), a handwriting-style typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. This is an open source font family first published by the Indian Type Foundry in 2014
* [Four Seasons Font (春夏秋冬)](http://www.freejapanesefont.com/four-seasons-font-download/),  a tidy, good looking handwriting style font written with pen. You can use this for any projects including commercial ones

Social icons were created thanks to [Simple Icons](http://simpleicons.org/).
